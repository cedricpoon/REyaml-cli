# REyaml-core
 Core & CLI in REyaml for YAML to D3 model transformation

## To-do
- [x] npm
- [x] cicd
- [x] shrink modules and diversify objects
- [x] cli
- [x] full documentation

## Manual CI Test
1. Are modules in reyaml-core mutable (i.e. standalone) enough?
2. Is reyaml-core cli working fine?
3. Is reyaml-core working fine on reyaml-ui?
4. Are sample YAML all passed?
   - Openshift YAML Template
   - Istio YAML
   - Arbitrary YAML
5. Is reyaml-core efficient enough?
   - Line skipping
   - Live updating
   - Character traversing
